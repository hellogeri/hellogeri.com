			<h1>The Problem With Style Guides</h1>
			<p>Posted in <a href="/blog/advertising">Advertising</a>, <a href="/blog/artanddesign">Art & Design</a>, <a href="/blog/webdesign">Web Design</a>, on <time pubdate datetime="2012-10-30T12:23:31-03:30">October 30, 2012</time></p>
		</header>
		<p class="excerpt-lg">Last week, my friend <a href="http://rainypixels.com">Nishant Kothary</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rainypixels/status/260867722357911553">tweeted</a> about how he had concluded that style guides are the &#8220;most useless design deliverables in existence.&#8221; Instead of discussing it over Twitter, we each decided to blog our thoughts. </p>
		<p>I&#8217;ll say right away that I believe style guides for websites are headed down the right path and are an important asset. <a href="http://www.maban.co.uk/">Anna Debenham</a> wrote a <a href="http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides">great article</a> in last year&#8217;s 24 Ways about the benefits of front-end style guides. My problems with style guides stem from the traditional &#8220;graphic standards manuals&#8221; that are either written as though they are carved in stone and ruled with an iron first, or, style guides that seem like complete afterthoughts and aren&#8217;t enforced in any way at all.</p>
		<q>While it’s very important to keep the most critical elements of a brand consistent across all materials, there should be more opportunity for discussion with the brand guardians if new ideas are proposed.</q>
		<p>Style guides are intended to protect the integrity of the brand when in the hands of other designers. They&#8217;re meant to make workflow faster and to reduce the number of decisions a designer has to make. While the intentions are good, most style guides that I&#8217;ve worked with have created problems, too.</p>
		<h2>Stifling Creativity</h2>
		<p>Working at an advertising agency, I&#8217;ve had to work with many graphic standards manuals from large companies and organizations. Most guides share common elements like rules for approved typefaces, colour palettes, and logo usage; but others have been dozens and dozens of pages in length, spelling out every detail of what&#8217;s allowed and what&#8217;s forbidden. These guides can be so strict that it can be virtually impossible to introduce a little creativity. You might not be allowed to place a logo over a photograph, even if it&#8217;s perfectly legible. You might be forced to place a logo at the bottom right-hand side of a page every time, even though it might look better in your design if it was centered on the page. Often, you&#8217;ll need to send your work back for approval, and if you don&#8217;t adhere to the rules, it&#8217;ll be rejected. While it&#8217;s very important to keep the most critical elements of a brand consistent across all materials, there should be more opportunity for discussion with the brand guardians if new ideas are proposed.</p>

While the intentions are good, most style guides that I&#8217;ve worked with have created problems, too.</p>
		<h2>Being a &#8220;Brand Guardian&#8221; Isn&#8217;t Easy</h2>
		<p>If you&#8217;re publishing a style guide intended for use by designers and developers on a internal team, there&#8217;s a decent chance that it will be followed. The heavily-referenced <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/">Starbucks style guide</a> comes to mind, here. If you&#8217;re creating a style guide that&#8217;s going to be shared with people outside of the design department who may not even have design skills, things can quickly fall apart. One of the worst offenders I&#8217;ve seen for this are universities. </p>
		<p>Here is a sample of some code. It is a fancy <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>.</p>
		<h2>Updates</h2>

			<p>A well designed brand style guide maintained by a good creative director/team will hold up the brand's integrity.</p>
			<p>A style guide is meant to be just that, a guide. If you use it as some kind of "bible" for the brand, it'll just get stale and boring really fast.</p>
			<p>To NOT have brand guidelines is asking for non-cohesive communication material and different variations on the brand depending on what designer is working on it. Then again, even a good brand guideline in the hands of a bad designer is worthless for anything more than maybe light consistency.</p>
